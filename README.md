# Flight Delay Prediction Project ðŸš€

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict flight delays based on historical data.

## Project Overview
Flight delays are a major issue for passengers and airlines, resulting in lost revenue, passenger dissatisfaction, and operational challenges. This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of flight delays based on historical flight data.

## Problem Statement
Predicting flight delays based on multiple factors such as weather conditions, airport traffic, flight schedules, and historical data.

## Approach
 **Data Preprocessing**
**Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and correcting data inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features like time of day, season, and weather conditions.
**Normalization:** Scaling numerical features to improve model performance.
**Machine Learning Models**
**Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
**Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
**Final Model:** Random Forest Classifier with the highest accuracy.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning** (Supervised learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

## Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model training and evaluation using various ML algorithms.
- Visualizations of prediction accuracy and results.

## How to Run the Project:
1. **Clone the repository**: `(https://github.com/Bhavya-Arora-1/Flight-delay-prediction)`
2. **Install dependencies**:  
   - Use the `requirements.txt` file if available:  
     `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
   - Or manually install libraries:  
     `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter`

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:  
   - Start Jupyter Notebook:  
     `jupyter notebook`
   - Open `Bhavya_Flight_delay.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.
