# Flight Delay Prediction Project ðŸš€

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict flight delays based on historical data.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning** (Supervised learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

## Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model training and evaluation using various ML algorithms.
- Visualizations of prediction accuracy and results.

## How to Run the Project:
1. **Clone the repository**: `(https://github.com/Bhavya-Arora-1/Flight-delay-prediction)`
2. **Install dependencies**:  
   - Use the `requirements.txt` file if available:  
     `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
   - Or manually install libraries:  
     `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter`

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:  
   - Start Jupyter Notebook:  
     `jupyter notebook`
   - Open `Bhavya_Flight_delay.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.
